# Brain-classification
First project of "Statistical Learning" master's course, realized in RStudio in June 2023.
The task was a binary classification over a multivariate time series dataset retrieved from the ABIDE project.
The assignement is contained in the "hw-02.pdf" file, while you can find the test set as an example of the data we worked on in "hw-03-test.zip". 
Our work consists in "library_HW2.r" and "G22_HW2_pipeline.R", and it's resumed in "G22_HW2_report.html".
